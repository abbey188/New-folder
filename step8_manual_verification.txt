# Step 8 Manual Verification Guide

Use this guide to manually verify that the level objectives feature has been implemented correctly.

## Step 1: Open the Project in Godot
- Launch Godot Engine
- Open your "Dot" project
- Run the main scene

## Step 2: Check the UI Elements
Verify that:
- There is an objective UI element at the top center of the screen
- The objective text shows something like "Clear 10 red dots"
- The progress counter shows "0/10" initially

## Step 3: Test Objective Tracking
1. Find and connect at least 3 dots of the color mentioned in the objective
2. Verify that the progress counter increases when dots of the correct color are cleared
   - For example, if clearing red dots, the counter might change from "0/10" to "1/10"
3. Continue clearing dots of the target color
4. Verify that clearing dots of other colors doesn't affect the progress counter

## Step 4: Test Objective Completion
1. Set a lower objective for testing (you can modify the code to set objective_count to 3)
2. Clear enough dots to meet the objective
3. Verify that the progress counter shows completion (e.g., "3/3")
4. Check if the objective_completed signal is emitted (additional UI feedback would be implemented in Step 9)

## Step 5: Test Resetting
1. Reset the game (either through game logic or by restarting)
2. Verify that the objective and progress counter reset properly

## Common Issues
If verification fails, check:
1. The objective UI might be missing or positioned incorrectly
2. Color tracking logic might not be working correctly in game_grid.gd
3. The track_cleared_dots function in game_ui.gd might have issues
4. The set_objective function might not update the display correctly

## Test Pass Criteria
The test passes if:
- Objective text is clearly displayed
- Progress tracking works for the target color
- Progress counter updates correctly
- Other game functionality continues to work alongside objectives

If all checks pass, you can consider Step 8 complete and proceed to Step 9.
