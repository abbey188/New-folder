Step 5 Verification: MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED

Please manually verify the dot connection functionality:

1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. Run the main scene
3. Test the connection logic by:
   - Tapping a dot to select it
   - Dragging/tapping to adjacent same-colored dots to connect them
   - Verify a line appears between connected dots
   - Connect at least 3 dots of the same color
   - Release the touch/mouse button to clear the connected dots
   - Verify that dots fade out with a scaling animation when cleared

The implementation includes:
- Ability to connect adjacent dots of the same color
- Visual line representation of connections with proper styling
- Rules for valid connections (same color, adjacent position)
- Support for backtracking on connection path
- Dot clearing with fade-out animation when 3+ dots are connected

Verify these features are working properly before proceeding to Step 6.
