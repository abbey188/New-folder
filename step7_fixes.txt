# Step 7 Verification Script Fixes

The verification script may be failing for several reasons. Here are the common issues and how to fix them:

## Issue 1: Node Path Problems
Make sure your scene structure matches what the verification script expects:
- The main scene should have a GameGrid node at "/root/Main/GameGrid"
- The main scene should have a GameUI node at "/root/Main/GameUI"
- The GameUI node should have containers named "MovesContainer" and "ScoreContainer"

## Issue 2: Method Implementation
Ensure these methods are implemented:
- GameUI.update_moves_display()
- GameUI.update_score_display()
- GameUI.use_move()
- GameUI.add_score()
- GameGrid.reset_game()
- GameGrid.reset_selections()
- GameGrid.select_dot()
- GameGrid.try_connect_dot()
- GameGrid.handle_touch_release()

## Issue 3: Game State Variables
Make sure your GameUI has:
- moves_left = 16 initially
- current_score = 0 initially

## Issue 4: Running the Script
You can run the verification script in multiple ways:
1. From Godot Editor:
   - Open the project in Godot
   - Open the Test Scene (scenes/test_step7.tscn)
   - Click the "Play" button or F5

2. From command line (replace with your Godot path):
   - `"C:/Path/To/Godot/Godot_v{version}.exe" --path "C:/Path/To/Project" --script scripts/run_step7_test.gd`

## Issue 5: Manual Testing
If automated testing continues to fail, you can manually test:
1. Open the main scene in the editor and click "Play"
2. Make sure:
   - You can see "MOVES: 16" at the top of the screen
   - You can see "SCORE: 0" at the top of the screen
   - When you connect 3+ same-color dots, the moves decrease
   - When dots are cleared, the score increases

## Issue 6: Script Exceptions
If you get any error messages in the Godot console:
1. Check line numbers in the error message
2. Fix the code at those line numbers
3. Check for null references
4. Ensure your implementation matches what's in the manual verification instructions

## Step by Step Verification
1. Check that GameUI nodes exist
2. Check if both GameGrid and GameUI are properly connected to the main scene
3. Confirm move counter starts at 16
4. Verify that use_move() decreases the counter
5. Confirm that add_score() adds to the score
6. Verify that connecting dots decreases moves
7. Verify that clearing dots increases score
