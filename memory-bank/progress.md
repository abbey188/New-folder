# Project Progress Log

## Step 1: Set Up the Project in Godot (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Created a new Godot project named "Dot"
- Configured project settings:
  - Set default resolution to 720x1280 (portrait mode)
  - Enabled 2D rendering mode
  - Set up the main scene
- **Test Results:** Game window successfully opens at 720x1280 with no errors
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 2: Create the Game Grid (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Implemented a 6x6 grid of dots using Sprite2D nodes
- Set each dot to be 85 pixels in diameter
- Used spacing of 47 pixels between dots (edge-to-edge)
- Centered the grid horizontally and vertically on screen
- Assigned a default gray color to each dot
- **Test Results:** 6x6 grid of properly sized and spaced gray dots displayed on screen
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 3: Implement Dot Coloring (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Modified the grid script to assign random colors to dots
- Implemented a color palette with 5 distinct colors:
  - Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Purple
- Added randomization to ensure different patterns on each game start
- Stored color information as metadata for future game logic
- **Test Results:** Code implementation verified, dots display random colors when game runs
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 4: Enable Touch Input for Dot Selection (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Added touch input detection to the grid script
- Implemented dot selection toggling with visual feedback:
  - 10% scale increase for selected dots
  - White glow effect applied via modulate property
- Added metadata tracking of selected state for each dot
- Used Vector2 grid position metadata for dot position tracking
- Created verification script to simulate and test touch input
- **Test Results:** Touch input successfully selects/deselects dots with proper visual feedback
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 5: Implement Dot Connection Logic (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Added logic to connect adjacent, same-colored dots when selected
- Implemented visual connection line between dots with properties:
  - Line thickness: 8 pixels (approx. 1/10th of dot diameter)
  - Line color: Matching the color of the connected dots with subtle white blending
  - Line style: Solid with 80% opacity and rounded joints/ends
- Added rules for valid connections:
  - Dots must be the same color
  - Dots must be adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally)
  - Added support for backtracking when making connections
- Implemented dot clearing with animation:
  - Connected dots fade out and scale up over 0.4 seconds
  - Dots are removed from grid after animation completes
  - Created null spaces in grid (to be handled in Step 6's refill logic)
- **Test Results:** Dots can be connected, visually linked with a line, and properly cleared when 3+ are connected
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 6: Refill the Grid After Clearing Dots (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Implemented grid refill system with two main components:
  - Column collapse: Existing dots slide down to fill empty spaces
  - New dot generation: Fresh dots appear at the top of columns
- Added smooth animations for both processes:
  - Existing dots drop with a 0.2 second animation
  - New dots appear above the grid and fall into place
  - Used easing curve for natural movement feel
- Implemented state management during animations:
  - Added is_processing flag to prevent input during animations
  - Added proper null-checking for empty grid spaces
  - Sequenced animations to ensure proper timing
- Added a small delay (0.05s) between clearing and refilling for visual clarity
- **Test Results:** Grid successfully refills after dots are cleared, with proper animations and complete restoration
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 7: Add Move Counter and Scoring System (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Created UI elements for game state tracking:
  - Move counter showing available moves (starting at 16)
  - Score display showing current points
- Implemented a CanvasLayer-based UI system with:
  - Styled panels with rounded corners
  - Clear labeling of "MOVES" and "SCORE"
  - Proper positioning at the top of the screen
- Added scoring mechanics:
  - Basic scoring: 1 point per dot cleared
  - Bonus scoring for special patterns:
    - 50% bonus for square patterns
    - 50% bonus for long chains (10+ dots)
- Integrated game state management:
  - Decreasing moves when valid connections are made
  - Tracking score accumulation throughout gameplay
  - Detecting when player has no moves left
  - Providing simple game reset functionality
- **Test Results:** UI elements display correctly, moves decrease with each connection, and score increases when dots are cleared
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 8: Implement Level Objectives (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Added objective UI elements to the game interface:
  - Displayed at the top center of the screen
  - Shows the current objective (e.g., "Clear 10 red dots")
  - Includes a progress counter (e.g., "0/10")
- Implemented color-based objective tracking:
  - Updated dot creation to track color indices
  - Modified dot clearing logic to track cleared dot colors
  - Added objective progress tracking in the UI
- Created an objective completion system:
  - Progress updates in real-time as target dots are cleared
  - Added objective_completed signal to detect when goals are met
  - Built reset functionality to allow for new objectives
- Added flexible objective setting:
  - Support for different objective types (currently "color")
  - Ability to set different target amounts
  - Framework for expanding to other objective types later
- **Test Results:** Objective UI displays correctly, progress is tracked when clearing dots of the target color, and completion is detected
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 9: Create Level Completion Logic
  - Display "Level Complete" when objective is met within move limit
  - Show "Level Failed" when moves are exhausted before completion
  - Implement star rating based on remaining moves
  - Add UI popups for level status
