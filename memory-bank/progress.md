# Project Progress Log

## Step 1: Set Up the Project in Godot (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Created a new Godot project named "Dot"
- Configured project settings:
  - Set default resolution to 720x1280 (portrait mode)
  - Enabled 2D rendering mode
  - Set up the main scene
- **Test Results:** Game window successfully opens at 720x1280 with no errors
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 2: Create the Game Grid (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Implemented a 6x6 grid of dots using Sprite2D nodes
- Set each dot to be 85 pixels in diameter
- Used spacing of 47 pixels between dots (edge-to-edge)
- Centered the grid horizontally and vertically on screen
- Assigned a default gray color to each dot
- **Test Results:** 6x6 grid of properly sized and spaced gray dots displayed on screen
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 3: Implement Dot Coloring (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Modified the grid script to assign random colors to dots
- Implemented a color palette with 5 distinct colors:
  - Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Purple
- Added randomization to ensure different patterns on each game start
- Stored color information as metadata for future game logic
- **Test Results:** Code implementation verified, dots display random colors when game runs
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Step 4: Enable Touch Input for Dot Selection (Completed)
- Date: [Current Date]
- Added touch input detection to the grid script
- Implemented dot selection toggling with visual feedback:
  - 10% scale increase for selected dots
  - White glow effect applied via modulate property
- Added metadata tracking of selected state for each dot
- Used Vector2 grid position metadata for dot position tracking
- Created verification script to simulate and test touch input
- **Test Results:** Touch input successfully selects/deselects dots with proper visual feedback
- **Status:** ✓ Complete

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 5: Implement Connection Logic
  - Add functionality to connect dots of the same color
  - Create visual line connection between selected dots
  - Implement rules for valid connections (adjacent dots, same color)
