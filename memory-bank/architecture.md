# "Dot" Game Architecture

## Project Structure

The "Dot" game follows Godot's scene-based architecture pattern, with a modular design that separates different game components into reusable scenes.

### Main Components

1. **Main Scene (`main.tscn`)**
   - Acts as the entry point and container for all game elements
   - Responsible for scene transitions and maintaining global state
   - Will load other scenes (game grid, level map, etc.) as needed

2. **GameGrid Scene** (to be implemented)
   - Will contain the 6x6 grid of interactive dots
   - Will handle dot generation, connection detection, and clearing logic
   - Will implement game mechanics like scoring and level completion

3. **UI Components** (to be implemented)
   - Move counter, score display, level objectives
   - Level completion/failure screens
   - Menus and settings

4. **Level System** (to be implemented)
   - JSON-based level definitions
   - Level loading/saving mechanisms
   - Progress tracking

## File Organization

```
/
├── main.tscn             # Main game scene (entry point)
├── project.godot         # Project configuration
└── [future directories]
    ├── scenes/           # Game scenes (grid, level map, etc.)
    ├── scripts/          # GDScript code files
    ├── resources/        # Game resources (levels, save data)
    ├── assets/           # Visual and audio assets
    └── ui/               # UI scenes and components
```

## Data Flow

1. The main scene initializes the game and loads the appropriate subscene (level map or game grid)
2. When a level is selected, level data is loaded from JSON, configuring the game grid
3. Player interactions with the grid trigger game logic (matching, clearing, scoring)
4. Game state is updated and reflected in UI elements
5. Level completion/failure is detected and appropriate screens are displayed
6. Progress is saved locally using Godot's Resource system or JSON

This architecture prioritizes modularity and maintainability while following Godot's recommended patterns for 2D game development.
