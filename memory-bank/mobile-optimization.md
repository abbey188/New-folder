# Mobile Optimization Plan

## 1. Sprite Atlas Implementation
- Create a sprite atlas for all dot textures
- Combine UI elements into a single atlas
- Implement texture batching for reduced draw calls
- Target: Reduce draw calls by 50%

## 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement object pooling for:
  - Dot connection lines
  - Particle effects
  - UI animations
- Limit use of transparent textures
- Optimize shader usage
- Target: Maintain 60 FPS on mid-range devices

## 3. Memory Management
- Implement resource preloading
- Add memory cleanup for unused assets
- Optimize scene transitions
- Target: Reduce memory footprint by 30%

## 4. Mobile-Specific UI
- Adjust UI scaling for different screen sizes
- Implement safe area handling
- Optimize touch input response
- Target: Consistent UI across all device sizes

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Sprite Atlas Setup
1. Create sprite atlases for:
   - Dot textures (all colors)
   - UI elements
   - Particle effects
2. Update sprite references in scenes
3. Verify draw call reduction

### Step 2: Object Pooling System
1. Create ObjectPool singleton
2. Implement pools for:
   - Connection lines
   - Particle effects
   - UI animations
3. Update existing systems to use pools

### Step 3: Performance Monitoring
1. Add FPS counter
2. Implement draw call counter
3. Add memory usage tracking
4. Create performance logging system

### Step 4: Mobile UI Optimization
1. Implement safe area handling
2. Add dynamic UI scaling
3. Optimize touch input system
4. Test on various screen sizes

## Test Cases
1. Performance Tests:
   - FPS should maintain 60 on target devices
   - Draw calls should not exceed 50
   - Memory usage should be stable

2. UI Tests:
   - All UI elements should be visible and properly scaled
   - Touch input should be responsive
   - Safe areas should be respected

3. Memory Tests:
   - No memory leaks during gameplay
   - Smooth scene transitions
   - Proper resource cleanup

## Success Criteria
- Game runs at 60 FPS on target devices
- Draw calls reduced by 50%
- Memory usage optimized by 30%
- UI consistent across all device sizes
- Touch input responsive and accurate
