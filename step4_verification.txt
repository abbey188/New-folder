Step 4 Verification: MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED

Since we can't run the automated verification from the command line, please manually check the following:

1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. Run the main scene
3. Try to tap/click on dots and verify:
   - Dots can be selected by tapping
   - Selected dots show visual feedback (10% scale increase and glow effect)
   - Dots can be deselected by tapping again

The implementation includes:
- Touch input detection in the grid script
- Dot selection toggling with proper visual feedback
- Metadata tracking of selected state for each dot
- Grid position metadata for dot position tracking

Verify these features are working properly before proceeding to Step 5.
