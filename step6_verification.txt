Step 6 Verification: MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED

Please manually verify the grid refill functionality:

1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. Run the main scene
3. Test the refill functionality by:
   - Connecting and clearing a group of 3+ dots of the same color
   - Observe that remaining dots slide down to fill empty spaces
   - Observe that new dots are generated at the top of columns
   - Verify that both animations (dropping and new dots) look smooth
   - After refill, check that the grid is fully restored to a 6x6 layout

The implementation includes:
- Column collapse functionality that moves dots down to fill empty spaces
- New dot generation at the top of columns
- Smooth animations for both existing dots sliding down and new dots appearing
- Proper handling of the game state during animations to prevent unwanted interactions
- Complete restoration of the grid to its original density

Verify these features are working properly before proceeding to Step 7.
