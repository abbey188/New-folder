# Step 7 Manual Verification Guide

Since you're experiencing issues with the automated verification script, here's a manual verification process you can follow to confirm Step 7 has been implemented correctly.

## Step 1: Open the Project in Godot
- Launch Godot Engine
- Open your "Dot" project

## Step 2: Check the Scene Structure
Make sure:
- Your main.tscn has both GameGrid and GameUI nodes
- Your GameUI scene is structured correctly with MovesContainer and ScoreContainer

## Step 3: Check the Scripts
Ensure:
- game_ui.gd has all required methods: update_moves_display(), update_score_display(), use_move(), add_score()
- game_grid.gd calls these methods at the right times

## Step 4: Run and Test
1. Run the main scene (F5 or Play button)
2. Visually confirm:
   - You see "MOVES" at the top left with "16" underneath
   - You see "SCORE" at the top right with "0" underneath
3. Create a valid connection with at least 3 dots of the same color
4. Confirm:
   - The move counter decreases to 15
   - The score increases by at least 3 (or more if you cleared more dots)
   - If you connected dots in a square pattern or 10+ dots, verify the bonus multiplier works

## Step 5: Test Game Over
1. If possible, use all remaining moves until you reach 0
2. Verify the game resets properly

## Common Issues
If the verification fails, check:
1. Your user interface may be missing elements or is placed incorrectly
2. The game_grid.gd script might not be calling game_ui methods
3. Your functions might have errors or incorrect implementations

## Mark as Complete
If all the above tests pass, you can consider Step 7 complete and proceed to Step 8.
