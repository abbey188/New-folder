STEP 10: STAR RATING SYSTEM - MANUAL VERIFICATION

This document guides you through manually verifying the star rating system in the "Dot" game.

OVERVIEW:
The star rating system awards 1-3 stars based on how many moves are left when completing a level:
- 3 stars: 5+ moves left
- 2 stars: 1-4 moves left
- 1 star: 0 moves left (but objective completed)

AUTOMATED TESTING:
1. Run the automated test by opening the test_step10.tscn scene and running it.
2. Check the console output for verification results.
3. All tests should pass, showing the star rating system works correctly.

MANUAL VERIFICATION:

TEST 1: THREE STARS (5+ MOVES LEFT)
1. Open the game scene or test scene.
2. Modify the game state to have 6 moves left and complete the objective.
   - You can use the test_step10.tscn scene which has this built-in.
   - Alternatively, play normally and try to complete the objective with 5+ moves left.
3. Verify that the level completion popup shows THREE stars with a pleasant animation.
4. Each star should appear with a slight delay and scale up with a bounce effect.

TEST 2: TWO STARS (1-4 MOVES LEFT)
1. Reset the game or restart the test.
2. Modify the game state to have 3 moves left and complete the objective.
   - Use the test scene or play normally until you have 1-4 moves left.
3. Verify that the level completion popup shows TWO stars with animation.
4. The first two stars should be visible and animated, while the third star remains hidden.

TEST 3: ONE STAR (0 MOVES LEFT)
1. Reset the game or restart the test.
2. Modify the game state to have 0 moves left and complete the objective.
   - Use the test scene or play normally until you have exactly 0 moves left.
3. Verify that the level completion popup shows only ONE star with animation.
4. Only the first star should be visible and animated.

TEST 4: LEVEL FAILED
1. Reset the game or restart the test.
2. Use all moves without completing the objective.
3. Verify that the level failed popup shows NO stars.
4. Confirm that the popup title shows "LEVEL FAILED" instead of "LEVEL COMPLETE".
