Step 7 Verification: MANUAL CHECK REQUIRED

Please manually verify the move counter and scoring system:

1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. Run the main scene
3. Test the move counter functionality by:
   - Checking that the moves counter starts at 16
   - Connecting and clearing a group of 3+ dots
   - Verifying that the moves counter decreases by 1
   - Continuing until the counter reaches 0 to verify the "no moves left" logic works

4. Test the scoring functionality by:
   - Checking that the score starts at 0
   - Connecting and clearing a group of 3+ dots
   - Verifying that the score increases by the number of dots cleared
   - Trying to form square patterns or long chains (10+ dots) to test score multipliers

The implementation includes:
- Move counter UI element showing number of remaining moves
- Score display showing current score
- Decrementation of moves after each valid connection
- Scoring system that gives 1 point per dot cleared
- Special scoring for:
  - Square patterns (+50% bonus)
  - Long chains of 10+ dots (+50% bonus)
- Game over detection when moves run out

Verify these features are working properly before proceeding to Step 8.
